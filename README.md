# Algorithms & data structures for Codevita

Algorithms and data structures are fundamental to efficient code and good software design. Creating and designing excellent algorithms is required for being an exemplary programmer. This repository's goal is to demonstrate how to correctly implement common data structures and algorithms in the simplest and most elegant ways.

# Contributing

This repository is contribution friendly :smiley:. If you'd like to add or improve an algorithm, your contribution is welcome! Please be sure to check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/bhavin3524/Codevita) for instructions.

### Programming languages?

This repository provides algorithm implementations in **Java**, however, there are other forks that provide implementations in other languages, most notably:

* **Java**: https://github.com/bhavin3524/Codevita
* **Scala**: https://github.com/bhavin3524/Codevita

# Running an algorithm implementation

To compile and run any of the algorithms here, you need at least JDK version 8. Maven can make things more convenient for you, but it is not required.
